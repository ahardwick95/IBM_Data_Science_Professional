# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Performance Dashboard - Python Project for Data Science (IBM)

This repository contains the final project for the **"Python Project for Data Science"** course, part of the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate** on Coursera. In this project, I assume the role of a Data Scientist at a startup investment firm tasked with analyzing historical stock data to uncover insights and trends.

## ðŸ§  Project Objective

To design a **data analytics dashboard** that extracts and visualizes financial dataâ€”such as historical stock prices and quarterly revenuesâ€”of well-known companies to support investment decision-making.

- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** â€“ for data manipulation
- **Plotly** â€“ for building interactive visualizations and dashboards
- **Requests / BeautifulSoup** â€“ for web scraping quarterly revenue data
- **Yahoo Finance API** â€“ for historical stock price data
- **Jupyter Notebooks** â€“ development environment
- **IBM Skills Network Labs** â€“ cloud-based lab environment
- **IBM Watson Studio** â€“ project workspace and deployment (optional)

## ðŸ“Š Dashboard Analytics Features

The dashboard displays:
- **Line charts** of historical share prices over time
