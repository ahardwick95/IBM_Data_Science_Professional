# 📊 Data Visualization with Python  
*IBM Data Science Professional Certificate*

## 📁 Overview

This repository contains my work for the **"Data Visualization with Python"** course, part of the [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science) offered on Coursera. The course focuses on using Python libraries to create insightful and effective visualizations that uncover patterns, trends, and stories hidden in data.

Through this course, I explored various visualization techniques and tools including **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Folium**, applying them to real-world datasets across domains such as economics, geography, and demographics.
