# ðŸš€ SpaceX Launch Analysis Capstone Project

This is the final capstone project for the [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science) program. In this project, I analyzed SpaceX launch records to determine whether SpaceXâ€™s Falcon 9 first-stage rocket boosters successfully landed, as a step toward cost-effective space missions.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Objective

The goal of this project was to apply the entire data science workflow â€” from data collection to interactive visualizations â€” in order to:

- Identify factors influencing successful rocket landings
- Use machine learning to predict outcomes of future launches
- Communicate insights through visualizations and a dashboard

---

## ðŸ§° Technologies and Tools Used

- **Languages**: Python, SQL
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas, NumPy
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
  - Scikit-learn
- **Tools & Platforms**:
  - Jupyter Notebooks
  - IBM Watson Studio
  - Folium (for map visualizations)
  - Dash (for interactive dashboard)

---

## ðŸ“Š Project Workflow

### 1. Data Collection
- Collected launch data from the SpaceX API and Wikipedia using web scraping.

### 2. Data Wrangling & Cleaning
- Processed and structured raw data into a usable format.
- Handled missing values, incorrect types, and inconsistent formatting.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed launch success rates by location, payload, orbit, and landing type.
- Created insightful visualizations to uncover patterns.

### 4. Feature Engineering
- Converted categorical data to numerical formats (e.g., One-Hot Encoding).
- Built new features from date and location info.

### 5. Model Building & Evaluation
- Built and evaluated several models to predict landing success:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machines
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forests
- Used Grid Search and Cross-Validation for tuning and evaluation.

### 6. Dashboard Deployment
- Developed an interactive dashboard using Plotly Dash to visualize launch outcomes by site, payload, and success probability.
