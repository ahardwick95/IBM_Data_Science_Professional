#IBM Data Science Professional Certificate

🚀 Repository Overview
This repository showcases four key projects from the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate that demonstrate my ability to solve real-world problems using:

Python (web scraping, analysis, dashboards)

SQL (complex queries, data wrangling)

Machine Learning (predictive modeling, regression)

End-to-End Data Science (full project lifecycle)

Each project was selected for its resume-worthiness, emphasizing technical rigor, business relevance, and clear communication of insights.

🔍 Featured Projects
1. Python Project for Data Science
📌 Scope: Web scraping, financial data analysis, and interactive dashboard creation.
📂 Example: Analyzed historical stock/revenue data (e.g., Tesla, GameStop) using:

BeautifulSoup/yfinance for data extraction

Pandas for cleaning/transformation

Plotly/Dash (or Matplotlib/Seaborn) for dynamic visualizations
🎯 Key Skills: API integration, trend analysis, storytelling with data.

2. SQL Data Analysis Projects
📌 Scope: Querying real-world datasets (e.g., census, crime, education demographics).
📂 Examples:

Identified socioeconomic patterns in census data using joins/subqueries.

Optimized queries for performance on large datasets.
🎯 Key Skills: SQL optimization, data aggregation, translating business questions into queries.

3. Data Visualization & Predictive Modeling
📌 Scope: EDA, regression, and hypothesis testing with Python libraries.
📂 Examples:

Predicted housing prices using Scikit-learn (linear regression, random forests).

Visualized financial trends (e.g., GDP, unemployment) with Seaborn/Matplotlib.
🎯 Key Skills: Feature engineering, model evaluation, static/interactive visualization.

4. Capstone Project: SpaceX Launch Cost Prediction
📌 Scope: End-to-end analysis simulating a real business scenario (competitor to SpaceX).
📂 Deliverables:

Data collection (API/web scraping)

EDA and visual storytelling

Predictive model (e.g., classification to predict launch success)

Business insights (e.g., cost reduction strategies)
🎯 Key Skills: CRISP-DM methodology, stakeholder communication, ML deployment.

🛠️ Technical Toolkit
Languages & Libraries:

python
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn), SQL, Matplotlib/Seaborn, Plotly/Dash  
Tools & Platforms:

python
Jupyter Notebooks, IBM Watson Studio, Git, MySQL/SQLite  
📊 Why These Projects?
These projects were chosen because they:
✅ Solve realistic business problems (finance, operations, public policy).
✅ Cover the full data science pipeline (from scraping to ML deployment).
✅ Demonstrate clear technical progression (SQL → Python → end-to-end projects).

🌟 Next Steps
Expanding skills into deep learning (TensorFlow/PyTorch).

Building a portfolio website to host interactive dashboards.
